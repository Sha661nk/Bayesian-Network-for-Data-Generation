# Bayesian-Network-for-Data-Generation
Description: Data Generation using Bayesian Networks

This project focuses on data generation using Bayesian Networks (BNs). Bayesian Networks are probabilistic graphical models that represent relationships between variables using a directed acyclic graph. The project leverages BNs to generate synthetic data that closely resembles the characteristics and statistical properties of real-world data.

Key Features:

Implementation of data generation using Bayesian Networks
Incorporation of various BN algorithms for structure learning and parameter estimation
Support for discrete and continuous variables in the BNs
Integration with data pre-processing techniques to handle missing values and outliers
Evaluation metrics for assessing the quality and similarity of generated data
Example scripts and notebooks demonstrating the data generation process
Extensible and customizable for different use cases and datasets
Usage:

Install the required dependencies and libraries.
Prepare your input dataset and pre-process it if necessary.
Configure the BN structure learning algorithm and parameter estimation method.
Run the data generation process, specifying the desired number of synthetic instances.
Evaluate the generated data using appropriate metrics and compare it with the original dataset.
Customize the project code to suit your specific data generation requirements.
By using Bayesian Networks for data generation, this project provides a flexible and powerful approach to generate synthetic datasets that can be used for various purposes such as testing machine learning models, preserving privacy in data sharing, and conducting simulation studies.
